AgroTrace is a machine learning-based system that predicts crop yields
and provides cultivation recommendations. It analyzes climatic vari-
ables such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall to generate predictive
models. The system supports farmers in making informed decisions re-
garding crop selection and resource management. By leveraging envi-
ronmental data, AgroTrace demonstrates the potential of data-driven
approaches for precision agriculture. It represents a practical tool for
enhancing agricultural planning and productivity.
